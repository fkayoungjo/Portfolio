        <p>Hi! I’m Jordan. I'm a front end engineer, with some backend chops, who brings my ideas to life through code. I’m driven with a passion to learn, create, and have fun while doing it. I’ve transitioned to engineering to work creatively, build, and solve problems. Initially, I wasn’t sure about the transition but as soon as I completed my first project I knew this was for me. Seeing people's reaction gave me a sense of accomplishment and pride as I've never felt before. To see my vision coming to fruition on my laptop was surreal. In my last role as an operations manager, I became methodical, organized and good at managing my time. I’ve applied these skills during my time at the Flatiron School and with hard work and dedication I’ve become pretty good at Javascript, React, Redux and Rails. I’d like to use my skills in an opportunity as a front end web engineer. Let's make something special.</p>
