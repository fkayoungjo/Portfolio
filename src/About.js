        <Col><p>Hey! Iâ€™m Jordan. I'm born and raised in this great city of New York. I'm a Front End Engineer, with some Backend chops, who brings my ideas to life through code. Iâ€™m driven and have a passion to learn, create, and have fun while doing it. Iâ€™ve transitioned to engineering to work creatively, build meaningful projects, and solve problems. Initially, I wasnâ€™t sure about the transition but as soon as I completed my first project I knew this was for me. Seeing people's reaction gave me a sense of accomplishment and pride as I've never felt before. To see my vision coming to fruition on my laptop was surreal. In my last role as an operations manager, I became methodical, organized and good at managing my time. Iâ€™ve applied these skills during my time at the Flatiron School. With hard work and dedication Iâ€™ve become pretty good at Javascript, React, Redux and Rails. Iâ€™d like to use my skills in an opportunity as a Front End Engineer. Let's make something special!</p>
